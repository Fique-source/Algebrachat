# Algebrachat
This is a p2p chat using javascript and peerjs this requires you to first get a code from a person and then you can chat.

NOTE: This works for 2 people for now but in future I will add updates to make it robust.
Since, this is a website I want to make it like discord where you don't have to put in a code to chat in near future.
